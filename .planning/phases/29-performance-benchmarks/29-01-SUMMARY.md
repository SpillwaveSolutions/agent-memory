# Phase 29 Plan 01: Performance Benchmarks Summary

**Documented perf_bench usage, baseline expectations, and added baseline metadata defaults.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 0 min
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- Added baseline label handling to keep `baseline.json` self-identifying and future-proof
- Created initial baseline file with thresholds and step placeholders for all tier/mode pairs
- Documented perf_bench runs, outputs, trace input, and baseline update workflow

## Files Created/Modified
- `crates/e2e-tests/src/bin/perf_bench.rs` - Baseline metadata defaults for `baseline.json`
- `crates/e2e-tests/benchmarks/baseline.json` - Baseline schema with thresholds and step keys
- `docs/benchmarks.md` - Benchmark usage, outputs, and baseline update guidance

## Decisions Made
None - followed plan as specified.

## Deviations from Plan

### Manual follow-up required

**1. Baseline metrics not generated by running perf_bench**
- **Reason:** Benchmark execution not run in this session
- **Impact:** Placeholder metrics (zeros) prevent regression comparisons
- **Follow-up:** Run perf_bench with `--write-baseline` for small/medium and cold/warm

## Issues Encountered
None.

## User Setup Required
- Run perf_bench to populate baselines with real metrics for all tier/mode combinations.

## Next Phase Readiness
Ready once baselines are captured.
